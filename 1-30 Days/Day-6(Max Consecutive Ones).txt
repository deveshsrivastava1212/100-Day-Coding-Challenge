Function- Kadane Algorithm

    class Solution {
    public:
        int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
            int currSum =0;
            int maxSum = 0;
            for(auto i:nums)
            {
                if(i == 1){
                    currSum ++;
                }
                else
                    currSum =0;
                
                maxSum = max(currSum, maxSum);
            }
            return maxSum;
        }
    };
