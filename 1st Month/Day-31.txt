Problem Statement-
                Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. 
                An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its 
                right side. The rightmost element is always a leader. 

                Example 1:

                Input:
                n = 6
                A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
                Output: 17 5 2
                Explanation: The first leader is 17 
                as it is greater than all the elements
                to its right.  Similarly, the next 
                leader is 5. The right most element 
                is always a leader so it is also 
                included.


Function-

            vector<int> leaders(int a[], int n)
                {
                    //may2021
                    vector<int> result;
                    result.push_back(a[n-1]);
                    int current_max=a[n-1];
                    
                    for(int i=n-2 ; i>=0 ; i--)
                    {
                        if(a[i] >=current_max )
                            {
                                result.push_back(a[i]);
                                current_max=a[i];
                            }
                            //comment
                    }
                    
                    
                    reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
                    
                    
                    return result;
                    
                }
