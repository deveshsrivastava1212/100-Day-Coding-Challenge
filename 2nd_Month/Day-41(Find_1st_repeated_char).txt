Problem Statement -

                Given a string S. The task is to find the first repeated character in it. We need to find the character 
                that occurs more than once and whose index of second occurrence is smallest. S contains only lowercase letters.

                Example 1:
                Input: S="geeksforgeeks"
                Output: e
                Explanation: 'e' repeats at third position.


Function - 

string firstRepChar(string s)
{
    //code here.
    string str="";
    unordered_map<char,int>mp;
    for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++)
    {
        mp[s[i]]++;
        if(mp[s[i]]>1)
        {
            str=str+s[i];
            return str;
        }
    }
    str=str+"-1";
    return str;
}
