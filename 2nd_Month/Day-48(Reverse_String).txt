Problem - Reverse Word in String
Problem Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

Problem Statement - 

                Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
                A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
                Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

                Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. 
                The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

                Example 1:

                Input: s = "the sky is blue"
                Output: "blue is sky the"


Function - 

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        stack<string> st;
        string ans;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++)
        {
            string word;
            if(s[i] == ' ')
                continue;
            while(i<s.size() && s[i] != ' ')
            {
                word += s[i];
                i++;
            }
            st.push(word);
        }
        while(!st.empty()){
            ans += st.top();
            st.pop();
            if(!st.empty())
                ans += " ";
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
