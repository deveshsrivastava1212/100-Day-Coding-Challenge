Problem - Reverse String

Problem Link -https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string

Problem Statement - 

                Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
                You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

                Example 1:

                Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
                Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Function - 
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int beg = 0;
        int end = s.size()-1;
        while(beg<end)
        {
            swap(s[beg++], s[end--]);
        }
    }
};
