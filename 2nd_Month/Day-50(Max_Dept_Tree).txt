Problem - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Problem Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Problem Statement-

                Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
                A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the 
                longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

                Example 1:

                Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
                Output: 3

Function- 
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL)    return 0;
        int leftDept = maxDepth(root->left);
        int rightDept = maxDepth(root->right);
        return 1+ max(leftDept, rightDept);
    }
};
