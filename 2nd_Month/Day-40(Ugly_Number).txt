Problem = Ugly Number

Problem Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/

Problem Statement- 

            An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
            Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

            Example 1:

            Input: n = 6
            Output: true
            Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
            Example 2:

            Input: n = 1
            Output: true
            Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.


Function - 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> primes = {2,3,5};
    bool isUgly(int n) {
        if (n < 1) return false;
        for(int p:primes) 
            while(n%p == 0)
                n /= p;
        return n==1;
    }
};
