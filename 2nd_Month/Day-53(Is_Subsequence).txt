Problem - Is Subsequence

Problem Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

Problem Statement - 

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by 
deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions 
of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true


Function - 
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int m = s.size();
        int n = t.size();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while(i < m && j < n)
        {
            if(s[i] == t[j])
            {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i == m ? 1 : 0;
    }
    
};
